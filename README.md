# traces.report
This project aims to surface travel patterns that might be hidden and shed new light on the relationship between people and places. Checkout the sample site generated from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j4yfiowEPDtMrYZyBqAV5Esujp8KCHBd9NrMs8-QVZw/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet<a> at <a href="https://traces.report/">traces.report</a>. You can create and access your personal site at <a href="https://traces.report/me">traces.report/me</a> using localStorage.

I've been keeping travel records in a Google Spreadsheet for many years, and this project has evolved over time. The current design enables me to reflect on my personal history and the relationship with different places I've lived, visited and left. It was a lovely surprise to open source the project, I hope more people can enjoy it like I have.

Created with Google Sheets API, localStorage and a habit of keeping records. This is a personal [project](https://yuinchien.com/travel-log/) of [Yuin](https://yuinchien.com/).
